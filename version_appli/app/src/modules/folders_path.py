"""
The following module provides functions for retrieving and recomposing the paths of specific folders 
within a given project structure. These paths are used to access the folders containing annotated 
images, non-annotated images, ground_truth, corrections, and results.

Functions included:
1. img_folder_training: Returns the path to the folder containing annotated images.
2. img_folder_inference: Returns the path to the folder containing non-annotated images.
3. ground_truth_folder_training: Returns the path to the folder containing annotation files.
4. corrections_folder_inference: Returns the path to the folder containing correction files.
5. get_results_folder: Constructs and returns the path to the results folder based on the provided YOLO model and image dataset folders.
